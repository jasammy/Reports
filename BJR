(A) BJR has two 3-DOF serial actuated legs, and
each leg has a hip, a knee and an ankle joint.

(B) Compared to the walking robot, jumping
robot not only can jump over obstacles of certain height, but
also has higher mobility. Therefore it has greater flexibility
and rapidity, and higher mobility in complicated terrains.

(C)  The biologically inspired
hopping robot Kenken has an articulated leg and uses two
hydraulic actuators as muscles and a tensile spring as a
tendon.

(D) artificial musculoskeletal system consists of two legs with hip,
knee, and ankle joints. We installed a pneumatic cylinder and
a torsion spring on each joint which has one degree of
freedom. 

(E)In order to decrease the
collision and increase the stability when landing, the feet are
made bigger which relieve the contact with the ground and
increase the stability of jumping.

(F) Task layer is responsible for
planning the overall tasks according to the obstacle and terrain
information. Gesture layer is responsible for setting
parameters and planning trajectory. Jump layer is responsible
for coordinating the actuated joints. Joint layer is responsible
for extending and contracting the joints.

(G) No pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers present in BJR due to which there are more chances of getting their parts damage.
