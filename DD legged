(a) A direct-drive (DD) robot forgoes the use of a gear,
belt, chain, or other reduction to amplify its motorsâ€™
effective torque production.

Advantages:
1. Transparency: DD actuation benefits robotics appli-
cations by avoiding backlash (uncontrolled motion due to gaps in parts), achieving high mechanical stiff-ness, and mitigating reflected inertia of the motor and coulomb and viscous friction in the gearbox so that motor dynamics can
be more quickly and easily influenced by external forces acting
on the leg.

2. High-bandwidth signal flow: Removing the gearbox
enables advantages in: sensing, mitigating low-pass spring
dynamics arising in SEA [3], as well as filter dynamics in
feeding back distal force/torque readings (slowing a 3kHz
control loop down to 600Hz in the latter case).

3. Specific power: Since a gearbox both increases mass
and decreases power (because of its associated losses), the
peak specific power of DD actuators will be significantly
higher than their geared counterparts.

Disadvantages:
1. Without a gearbox to amplify the output torque and decrease the output
speed, DD motors must operate in high-torque, low-speed
regimes where Joule heating is significant.

2. By removing the gearbox, mass-specific torque becomes our first limit-
ing resource in electromagnetically actuated robots.
