(a) The entire robot consists of the following major components: (1)
radio controller, (2) receiver, (3) controller module, (4) hopping
mechanism, and (5) feedback.
 (i) The Radio Controller is used to input commands wirelessly from
     the user to the robot.
 (ii) The Receiver located at the platform receives the commands
      and sends them to the controller module.
 (iii) The Controller Module converts user commands and the data from the
       sensors to be processed in the hopping algorithm.
 (iv) The Hopping Mechanism consists of
      three legs that have springs which continuously compress and
      decompress in a quick manner in order to lift the robot from the
      ground, thus performing a hopping movement.

(b) Five cases are used in the main program: four cases for the direc-
tion of the hopping robot, and one default case that will be execut-
ed when no input is detected from the remote controller.

(c) The Z-Angle (Yaw) for gyroscope is used to determine where the robot
is facing.

(d) the leg with the moving cam induces hopping on that particular leg and the high-bouncing ball underneath the legs assist in slightly increasing the hopping height.

(e)Use of cam: cam rotates which compresses the spring causing the robot to jump.
