(a) The knee joint is driven by a DC motor through the
reduction gears and the reduction ratio of this joint is 21.4
so that high backdrivability can be kept.The hip joint is
driven by a servo motor with only angle control.

(b) The weight of the RPLM robot
is approximately equal with that of EFLM robot.

(c) the EFLM robot can jump higher
because the vertical component of GRF impulse by EFLM
robot is larger than that by RPLM robot.

(d) the robot is constrained so that only vertical translational motion
and rolling motion are allowed by using a guide mechanism.

(e) After several jumping and landing motions,
the gear in the knee joint of the robot using RPLM was
damaged by the shock at touchdown while no damages
occurred on the robot using EFLM.From this result, we can
know that the shock from the ground during landing was
absorbed effectively by the elastic linkage.

(f) although the hydraulic cylinder is able to generate
large force, a big energy source is required to drive it.

(g) the robot with EFLM becomes more robust against the environment.

(h) The mechanism is composedof active hip and knee joints driven by electric rotary motors and passive ankle joint.
Knee joints and ankle joints are connected by a four-
bar linkage mechanism in which one linkage is elastic.

(i) These DC motors also help them to jump through reduction gears.
