(a) Using a technique called Parachute Landing Fall (PLF), a human jumper first land on one’s toes, and using the compliance of one’s knees, absorbs
the impact of landing by folding one’s leg and gently rolling
over to distribute the impact sequentially along the side of his
body.

(b) there are three major techniques for impact
attenuation of robotic landings: 1) active damping, 2) passive
damping or use of compliant legs, and 3) control of a robot’s
posture to guide the fall.

(c) compliant actuators can not only allow energy storage, but also allow for better shock tolerance.

(d) While walking, one or two feet might be off the ground, so we also require that the springs should be able to support half of the robot’s weight.

(e) Given the constraints of cost-effective rapid prototyping,
we decided to build our test robot of 3D-printed polylactic
acid (PLA) parts, as it is relatively straightforward to con-
struct a 3S configuration with 3D printed plastic parts.

(f) A robot can roll while falling to minimize stress on its structure.

1-Segment:
(a) The one-segment leg was designed like a POGO STICK. It does not have a knee and its length is directly affected by a spring, which its length is set by pulling a string that is connected to a pulley.

2-Segment compliant structure (2SCS):
(a) The two-segment compliant structure (2SCS) leg configuration has hips and knees that are directly actuated. The lower half of the leg is replaced by a spring.

2-Segment compliant joint (2SCJ):(has a knee servo)
(a) The two-segment compliant joint (2SCJ) leg configuration
has hips that are directly actuated and knees that are compliant.
The legs need to support the weight of the robot while walking.

3-Segment:
(a) The three-segment (3S) leg configuration has hips that are
directly actuated, and knees and ankles that are compliant.
